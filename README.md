# hackathon with pumpkins
This is our hackaton project for the course "Python for Vizualization"
We present some visualizations on planting giant pumpkins. Our intention was to check if pumpkins are bigger in more southern regions. 
Investigation is based on [dataset about giant pumpkins]([url](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2021/2021-10-19)) from TidyTuesday + [data]([url](http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/)) about geographical location of American and Canadian cities that pumpkins come from.

Our hypothesis was non confirmed.

Yours,
Alyona Zenina & Anna Kuchenina
